# HDF5IDX

This builds an index of a [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) file for direct and concurrent access to data chunks. This work is based on the [DMR++ module](https://github.com/OPENDAP/bes/tree/master/modules/dmrpp_module) in the [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) [Hyrax server](https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server).
